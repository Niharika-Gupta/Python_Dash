# Tools and Introduction
Here we will be using DASH from Python for the programming and we will be working databse provided in FLASK which comes with DASH library. and we will be using RF model in initial_modeling.py

This Repo consists of app.py file which has all the code related to front end the integration of backend to frontend with little CSS. 

Static Folder has the images displayed on the webpage.

We have an example CSV file for use to read it into the webpage.

initial_modeling.py consists of quick first look. Part I looks at univariate feature importance by separating into positive and negative instances for each target, and then ranking by p-values. Part II builds and tunes 3 models tolerant of high-dimensional feature sets and compares the results on each target.
